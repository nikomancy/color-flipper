# color-flipper

The point of the color flipper was to practice working with Vite + React and to build some components that change their color based on the color of other components.

I want to come back and add in:

- A typewriter effect to the color value.
- A tasteful gradient to the background color to make it pop a bit more.
- Some way to look up the hex value on [a website that gives color names](https://www.color-name.com/) and update text to show that name in addition to the value.
